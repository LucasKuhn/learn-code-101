# Basics

This a string:
```ruby
"Hello there"
```
It's how we represent text in Ruby, and we need quotations marks around it: `"`

This is a number:
```ruby
1
```
Obviously.

And this is Johny, the variable:
```ruby
johnny
```

Ruby is a [dynamically typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC), which is a fancy way to say that johnny the variable can be whatever he wants. He can be a string:
```ruby
johnny = "Beautiful"
```
And he can also be the solution to everything:
```ruby
johnny = 42
```
In which case, he is a number.
